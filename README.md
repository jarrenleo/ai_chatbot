### Examples

```
!o What is quantum computing?
!c Write me a poem about coding

```

### Maintaining Conversation Context

Reply to the bot's previous message to continue the conversation with history:

1. Send initial message: `!o What is TypeScript?`
2. Bot responds with an answer
3. Reply to that message: `!o Can you give me an example?`
4. Bot will remember the context from step 2

### Using Text File Attachments

Attach a `.txt` file along with your command to include additional context:

```
!c Summarize this document
[attach: document.txt]
```

### Character Limit Handling

The bot automatically splits responses longer than 2000 characters into multiple messages, intelligently breaking at word boundaries to maintain readability.
